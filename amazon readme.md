# Amazon Resource Access Prediction Model
# Overview
This project aims to develop a classification model using CatBoost Classifier to predict resource access patterns on the Amazon platform. The model predicts whether a user should be granted access to specific resources based on historical data and various features.

# Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model contains historical information about user access patterns, including user attributes, resource details, and access permissions. It includes both labeled data for training and unlabeled data for prediction.

# Model Training
The CatBoost Classifier is utilized to build the prediction model. CatBoost is a gradient boosting library that provides state-of-the-art results and supports categorical features inherently, making it suitable for our dataset which contains categorical variables.

# Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated using standard classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation techniques are employed to ensure robustness and generalization of the model.

# Usage
Data Preparation: Ensure that the dataset is preprocessed and formatted appropriately before training the model. Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Model Training: Train the CatBoost Classifier using the prepared training data. Tune hyperparameters if necessary to optimize model performance.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model using the testing dataset. Assess its performance based on classification metrics.

Prediction: Use the trained model to make predictions on new or unseen data to determine resource access permissions for users.
